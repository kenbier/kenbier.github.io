About a year and a half ago I moved up San Francisco.

I've been amazed at how active the technology community is here. In just my first few months I attended talks Nathan Marz, Jay Kreps, and Zach Tellman. I've met some really bright and funny people at the Clojure meetups I've been attending as well. Some of the talks people have made me rethink how I approach my work.

I've also been lucky to work in an amazing team at [AdStage](https://www.adstage.io/about-us/team/). We are a only three developers but we each compliment each other nicely; its by far the most harmonious team I've been apart of. I now truly believe that development is a *team sport*.

I plan to share some things I've learned or have been reading during my time here. Where to being...
